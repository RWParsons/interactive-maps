This is by no means comprehensive as it is based on methods that were used in developing the iTRAQI shiny app. However, since this book does focus on the applied problem of developing the iTRAQI shiny app, it includes specific help and methods for these are described here that may be otherwise difficult to find.

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.2.
