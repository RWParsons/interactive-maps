# Prerequisites

This book is intended as a non-comprehensive guide to developing interactive maps with leaflet and shiny. This is by no means comprehensive as it is based on methods that were used in developing the[iTRAQI shiny app](https://access.healthequity.link/). However, since this book does focus on the applied problem of developing the iTRAQI shiny app, it includes specific help and methods for these are described here that may be otherwise difficult to find. 

For a more comprehensive introduction to leaflet, see the 
[leaflet documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/).

For a more comprehensive introduction to shiny, see the
